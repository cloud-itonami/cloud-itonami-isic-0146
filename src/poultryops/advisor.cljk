  "PoultryOpsAdvisor -- the contained LLM/decision node. This actor's
  intelligence layer proposes back-office coordination actions (flock
  record logging including mortality and egg-production data,
  veterinary scheduling, health/biosecurity-concern flags, supply
  procurement) based on facility state and operator input. The advisor
  is SEALED into the `:advise` step of the operation flow; every
  proposal is routed through the independent Governor before committing.

  The advisor makes proposals but has NO direct authority. Proposals are
  always censored by:
    1. Governor (facility registration, closed-op allowlist, cost/health
       gates)
    2. Phase gate (rollout stage)
    3. Human operator (for escalated actions)

  Current implementation is a mock advisor for testing. Production should
  use langchain/Claude or similar LLM backend (same seam point as
  `swineops.advisor`, cloud-itonami-isic-0145)."
