# Operator Guide: Poultry-Farm Operations Coordinator

## Overview

The Poultry-Farm Operations Coordinator is a facility-management robot that:

1. **Logs operational data** — flock counts, weights, health notes, mortality, egg-production data
2. **Schedules coordination** — veterinary appointments, supply orders
3. **Escalates concerns** — any animal health or biosecurity issue (e.g. suspected HPAI)
4. **Maintains transparency** — audit ledger traces all decisions

The robot is **not** the decision-maker. The farm operator/veterinarian make
all decisions about animal welfare, treatment, and economic choices. The
robot **proposes** actions and escalates when human input is needed — it
never itself declares an outbreak or contacts animal-health authorities.

## Operating the Actor

### Prerequisites

1. **Facility Registration** — your barn/house facility must be registered in
   the system before any operation can proceed
2. **Authorized User** — operator must be authenticated and authorized
3. **Clear Request Type** — specify what you're doing:
   - `:log-flock-record` — record flock data (including mortality/egg-production)
   - `:schedule-veterinary-visit` — arrange vet appointment
   - `:flag-animal-health-concern` — report a concern
   - `:order-supplies` — procurement request

### Workflow

1. **Submit Request**
   ```clojure
   {:facility-id "farm-001"
    :op :log-flock-record
    :count 8000
    :health-status "healthy"}
   ```

2. **Actor Processes** (`operation/run-operation store request context`)
   - `:advise` — `PoultryOpsAdvisor` proposes an action (`poultryops.advisor`)
   - `:govern` — `PoultryFarmOperationsGovernor` checks hard invariants and escalation gates (`poultryops.governor`)
   - phase gate — rollout-phase constraints applied on top of the Governor's verdict (`poultryops.phase`)

3. **Outcomes** (`:disposition` on the return value)
   - **`:commit`** — operation logged, robot proceeds (`:record` is present)
   - **`:escalate`** — operation held pending human decision (audit fact `:t :approval-requested`)
   - **`:hold`** — operation blocked, hard violation (audit fact `:t :governor-hold`, cites `:violations`)

### Escalation Scenarios

**Automatic escalation (always human sign-off):**
- `:flag-animal-health-concern` — any welfare or biosecurity issue (e.g. suspected HPAI)
- Supply orders over cost threshold (default 500 currency units)
- Low confidence operations (< 0.7)

**Hard blocks (no override):**
- `:administer-treatment` — treatment decisions are veterinary authority
- `:order-culling` — economic/welfare decisions are human authority
- Missing/unregistered facility — must register first

### Resuming Escalated Operations

`poultryops.operation` is currently a synchronous stub (see its docstring):
one call to `(operation/run-operation store request context)` runs the full
`advise -> govern -> phase-gate` flow and returns immediately with a
`:disposition` of `:commit`, `:escalate`, or `:hold`. There is **no
persisted pause/resume yet** — that requires the deferred `langgraph-clj`
StateGraph integration (`interrupt-before` + checkpoint-based resume,
mirroring `cloud-itonami-isic-0141` and `cloud-itonami-isic-0145`). Until
then, an `:escalate` disposition means: **do not commit** — the caller
(production integration layer) is responsible for holding the proposal for
human review and re-submitting a follow-up operation once approved.

## Audit & Transparency

Every operation run returns an `:audit` vector containing an
advisor-proposal trace and a disposition fact (`:committed`,
`:governor-hold`, or `:approval-requested`). Production integration is
responsible for appending these facts to an append-only ledger (the
reference implementation does not include a ledger-writer — that's a
backend-integration concern, same seam point as the `Store`).

- Every proposal produces a trace, regardless of outcome
- Every hold cites the specific Governor rule(s) violated (`:violations`)
- Every escalation cites its `:reason` (always-escalate op / high cost / low confidence)

## Integration

The actor provides a standard protocol (`poultryops.store/Store`) for backend
integration:

- **Facility lookup** — `(store/registered-facility store facility-id)`

Implementations include in-memory `MemStore` (testing, `poultryops.store`),
and future Datomic/kotoba-server backends (the same seam point all
cloud-itonami actors use). Record-commit and ledger-append are integration
responsibilities on top of `operation/run-operation`'s return value, not
part of the `Store` protocol itself.

## Safety Guarantees

- **No unsupervised decisions** — no animal treatment or welfare decision is
  made by the robot
- **No suppressed concerns** — animal health/biosecurity concerns cannot be
  hidden or delayed
- **No unlogged operations** — every action is recorded in the audit ledger
- **No direct execution** — the governor gates every robot action

The robot is safe because:
1. It never decides — it proposes
2. It always escalates when needed
3. It never hides information
4. Every action is auditable
